    <string name="frontHazardText">Front Hazard Avoidance Cameras Is The Part Of "Hazard Cameras" Which Is The Part Of "Engineer Camera's'": Perseverance carries six newly developed Hazard Detection Cameras, called HazCams: four on the front and two on the rear of the rover body. HazCams detect hazards to the front and back pathways of the rover, such as large rocks, trenches, or sand dunes. Engineers also use the front HazCams to see where to move the robotic arm to take measurements, photos, and collect rock and soil samples. When driving, the rover stops frequently to take new stereo images of the path ahead to evaluate potential hazards. The 3D views give Mars 2020 the ability to make its own decisions about where to drive without consulting on every move with the rover team on Earth.</string>

    <string name="mastText">Mastcam-Z Is A Part Of Science Camera. It is a pair of cameras that takes color images and video, three-dimensional stereo images, and has a
powerful zoom lens. Like the Mastcam cameras on the Curiosity rover, Mastcam-Z on Mars 2020 consists of two
duplicate camera systems mounted on the mast that stands up from the rover deck. The cameras are next to
each other and point in the same direction, providing a 3-D view similar to what human eyes would see, only
better. They also have a zoom function to see details of faraway targets.</string>
